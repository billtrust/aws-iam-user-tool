You will need to setup MFA on your account.  Without doing this you will not have access to do anything in AWS apart from configure MFA.  To setup MFA, click the edit icon next to "Assigned MFA device" on the Security Credentials tab of your IAM user:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/{{iam_username}}?section=security_credentials

You will need to download a virtual authenticator such as Authy or Google Authenticator which are available in the iOS App Store or Google Play.  Authy is the recommended choice.

Note: After setting up MFA you may need to log out and log back into the AWS web console in order to change roles.

For more information on how to setup MFA, see:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html

{{#if roles}}
Your master account user has cross account roles which allow access to our AWS accounts for our other environments.  Once you log into AWS with your master account credentials, you can then assume the roles you were given access to, in order to access the other AWS environments.  Use the below links to access the other AWS environments.

{{#each roles}}
{{env_name}}
Assume Role URL:
{{assume_role_url}}
{{/each}}

To assume these roles with the command line or from code, follow these instructions:
{{/if}}
